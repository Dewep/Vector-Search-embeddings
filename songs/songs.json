All those little times you said that I'm your girl You make me feel Like your whole world [Pre-Chorus] I'll wait for you babe, That's all I do babe, Don't come through babe, You never do. [Chorus] Because I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry I'm pretty when I cry I'm pretty when I cry [Verse 2] All those special times, I spent with you my love. They don't mean shit, Compared to all your drugs. But I don't really mind, I've got my drugs and that. Like my memories, I don't need that. [Pre-Chorus] I'll wait for you babe, That's all I do babe, Don't come through babe, You never do. [Chorus] Because I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry. I'm pretty when I cry. I'm pretty when I cry. [Bridge] Don't say you need me when, You leaving, you leave again, I'm stronger than all my men, Except for you. Don't say you need me then, You leave last, you're leaving, I can't do it, I can't do it, But you do it best. [Hook] I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry. I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry. I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry. I'm pretty when I cry. [Outro] I'm pretty when I cry.",

We're getting older and older, and older And always a little further out of the way You look into her eyes and it's more than your heart will allow In August and Everything After, you get a little less than you expected, somehow... I stumbled into Washington Square just as the sun began to rise I lay down on the lawn of the cathedral Right down with the shadow of St. Mary's in the sky And I'm just one of these late model children waiting for the king Yeah, but there ain't no sign of Elvis in San Fransisco It's just me, and I'm playing this rock and roll thing And She wants to be just like me And I want every damn thing I can see. One day you're Daddy's little angel, The next day you're everything he wanted you to be They dress you up in white satin And they give you your very own pair of wings In August and Everything After, I'm after everything. I said and la la la la... Well now I got my reservations and I got my seven million-dollar home And I got, I got the number of some girl in New York City Who's always wide awake so I never have to spend the night alone I got this nasty little habit of peeking down the shirts Of all the little girls as they pass me by And I wonder if it all catches up to me Do you think they'll take me down? Do you think I'm gonna cry? Well, I've already got your disease, So take your fucking filthy hands off of me Well I hope you weren't expecting me to be crucified, The best that they can do is just to hang me from the nearest tree It's midnight in san francisco, and I am waiting here for jesus on my knees in august and everything after I want somebody else to bleed for me I said la la la la... Na na.... Well I came down from north dakota 'cause I had confidence in the military mind and now, everyone I know is turning show girl and is dancing with their shirt off in some las vegas hotel line so I'm going to new york city 'cause it gotta little sleazy here for me when I find myself alone I know I'm never going home I make the changes the changes that I need but I no longer know how to pray and I'm living in A dog town and it's A dalmation parade I change my spots, over and over but they never seem to fade away now I am the last remaining indian looking for the place where the buffalo roam in august and everything after, man them buffalo ain't never coming home I said in august and everything after, man them buffalo ain't never coming home I said na na...

No turning water into wine No learning while you're in the line I'll take you to the broken sign You see these lights are blue Come and get it Lost it at the city limit Say goodbye 'Cause they will find a way to trim it Everybody Lookin' for a silly gimmick Gotta get away Can't take it for another minute This town is made of many things Just look at what the current brings So high, it's only promising This place was made on you [Chorus] Tell me, baby, what's your story Where you come from And where you wanna go this time? Tell me, lover, are you lonely? The thing we need is Never all that hard to find Tell me, baby, what's your story Where you come from And where you wanna go this time? You're so lovely, are you lonely? Giving up on the innocence you left behind Some claim to have the fortitude Too shrewd to blow the interlude Sustaining pain to set a mood Step out to be renewed I'll move you like a baritone Jungle brothers on the microphone Getting over with an undertone It's time to turn to stone Chitty chitty, baby When your nose is in the nitty gritty Life could be a little sweet But life could be a little shitty What a pity Boston and a Kansas city Looking for a hundred But you only ever found a fitty Three fingers in the honeycomb You ring just like a xylophone Devoted to the chromosome The day that you left home [Chorus x 2]",

And I wonder at the ways The strands of love meander Through our close and distant days The blood of passion plays Burns our thirsty souls And chases reason far away... Far away... And still your gypsy wind Will soothe my soul and call me back again. Growing wise with age We come to see the printing Through the pictures on the page Though something's always lost The gain is always tempered by the cost.

    "lyrics": "Well, I met him in Minnesota, He was dark and overcast. With long, grey hair and eyes that stared Through me like I was glass. I asked \"Where are you going to?\" He said, \"I'm the wind I'm just blowing through.\" He lit up a cigarette and began to talk. Said: \"The doctors told me that my body won't hold me, My lungs are turning black. Been lucky strikes four since I was at school now there ain't no turning Back. They can't tell me how long I've got, Maybe months but maybe not, So I'm taking this bike and riding to New York. 'Cause I wanna see my grand-daughter one last time, Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny Heart beat next to mine. Wanna see my son and the man he's become, Tell him I'm sorry for the things I've done, And I'd do it if I had to walk. Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York Through the forests of West Constant That I knew as a boy, Past the sky line of Chicago, Round the lakes of Illinois I lay my head in a motel bed where my back gets sore and my eyes turn red, Listen to the trucks roll past my door. Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold. I run just like a river runs, rapid, quick and cold. And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turn piked holes. And I won't stop 'till I get to New York. 'Cause I wanna see my grand-son one last time. I wanna see his eyes sparkling ans stare back into mine. Now my time is short, I wanna see my daughter, Tell her all the things that I should have taught her And I'd do it if I had to walk. Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York. And I'd go up to the churchyard one last time, Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me the best years of my life, And I'd do it if I had to walk. Yeah, I'd do it if I had to walk. I'm taking this bike and riding to New York. \"",

To reap the harvest that was mine. The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow, And left me helpless in your embrace. The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing, Now slowly smoldering to dust. The celestial touch, from grey to black. A fathomless void enclosing. Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs. I can not endure. And so I rose from my sleep. The moon turned away its face. Overture of the long, black night begins Something you said: \"Eerie circles upon the waters\". Until now we have shared the same aura. My ashes within your hands. My breath in the sepulchral mound. You know that your night is my day. The final spark that blew life into me, The demon of the fall.",

She'll be lining up the cutlery, You know she's expecting me Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork\" And I'm down in the tube station at midnight I first felt a fist, and then a kick I could now smell their breath They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs And too many right wing meetings My life swam around me It took a look and drowned me in its own existence The smell of brown leather It blended in with the weather It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth It blocked all my senses Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer And I'm down in the tube station at midnight I said I was down in the tube station at midnight The last thing that I saw As I lay there on the floor Was \"Jesus saves\" painted by an atheist nutter And a British rail poster read \"have an away day, a cheap holiday Do it today!\" I glanced back on my life And thought about my wife Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me And I'm down in the tube station at midnight The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold I'm down in the tube station at midnight Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight",

Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to All throw down their bandannas and complain Maybe you want somebody you don't have to speak to Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Age 39, looking over from my hotel wind, Wondering if one should jump off or go to sleep. People tell you up is better than down, But they never tell you which is up and which is down. Age 39, looking over from my hotel wind, 95 pound bundle but it's trouble when there's nowhere to leave. People say stardust and golddust are it, But they never tell you it chokes you just as sawdust do. Age 39, feeling pretty suicidal, The weight gets heavier when you've bled thirty years. Show me your blood, john, and I'll show you mine, They say it's running even when you're asleep. No trace of resentment, no trace of regrets, One blood's thinner but both look red and fresh. If I ever die, please go to my daughter And tell her that she used to haunt me in my dreams. (That's saying a lot for a neurotic like me.) Age 39, looking over from my hotel window, Trying to tackle away with heart of clay. The weight gets lighter when there's nowhere to turn, God's little dandruff floating in the air. Age 39, looking over the world, Age 39, floating over the world, Age 39... Mm-mm... Floating along.",

Instead I am here alone, a bird in a cage. I will spread my wings and head home. Transylvania. Sock it to me baby. Burger, burger, One coffee, two burgers, three ham and cheese burgers, And one chicken sandwich. Poor on the mayo, pass me the relish. Some more onion rings",

Let's go cuddle in a corner, Any cozy little corner, Love is just around the corner, And I'm around you. Love is just around the corner, Any cozy corner, Love is just around the corner, When I'm around you. I'm ten times as faithful, As all your other men, They all are true to no one but you, But me I'm true to ten.

Right now!\" Then they'll pile up the bodies And I'll say, \"That'll learn ya!\" And the ship The Black Freighter Disappears out to sea And On It Is Me",

Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn anymore Stack the chairs on the table tops Hang the sheets on the chandeliers It slows down but it never stops Ain't it sweet after all these years And these are the last words I have to say It's always hard to say goodbye But now it's time to put this book away And that's the story of my life These are the last words I have to say That's why this took so long to write There will be other words some other day Ain't that the story of my life These are the last words I have to say Before another age goes by With all those other songs I'll have to play Ain't that the story of my life",

Were erased. Buried and burned Along with the memory of the dead Along with the ejido. With the smooth stroke of a pen And with the ghost of nixon present in their eyes They smiled. And pronounced the omnipitence Of the free market The profits of profit Extending the scurge of columbus and pizarro The freedom to buy things you can never afford The freedom for indians to buy corn that once flourished overgrown in their backyards The freedom to die of curable disease The freedom to watch their children's stomachs swell and burst The freedom to starve and die Without land Or liberty But ramona, with eyes of obsidian Peering through her blood and sweat drenched mask Darding, unseen Changing direction with the swiftness of a bird Through the shanty's of the canyon With every coyote, every insect, every phylum of life Urging her, propelling her forward. The leaves and branches of the forest Part for miles, clearing her path The voices and screams of the dead beneathe her feet Echo in the deepest chasm of her soul Hurling her, toward the city History surging through her veins Pulsing through her fingers Hurling her, towards the city She caresses her trigger And the words of magome fulfil her being And with each shot she fires, she affirms her movement Saying: Enough! Enough! No! I will see my own blood flow Before you take my land... Or my liberty",

I think it goes on and on forever, and if that's true and it was linked to the spiritual side of your lives, well, then sounds could be alive. Can you imagine the possibilities for the future ?

Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande? I can see it in your eyes How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land (Repeat x2) There was something in the air that night The stars were bright, Fernando They were shining there for you and me For liberty, Fernando Though I never thought that we could lose There's no regret If I had to do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando Yes, if I had to do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando...",

I'm trying to get to Heaven, could you tell me where that is?\" On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white I caught my first sign of Resurrection Mary I was trembling like a leaf, I was scared beyond belief After all my conscience ain't that clear I used to work for Mickey Finn, I did the numbers for Big Jim Perhaps my day of reckoning lies here I said, \"Please, please, I would dignify your wish But when it comes to Heaven, I'm just a little bit amateurish On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white I cheated time with Resurrection Mary And I felt tears form in my eyes for the first time, I felt something Deep inside and the first time I saw angels high in the air For the first time in my life, and I said, \"Mary, go to the light It's gonna be alright\" I got down on my knees, I said, \"Sweet Mary, please dignify These wishes before you run\", will you tell him I've reformed? Will you tell him I'm reborn? She closed her eyes And then she spoke in tongues I said, \"Please, please, tell me what he said\", she said \"You must die the day before the devil knows you're dead\" On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white I waved goodbye on a wild Chicago night",

A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief. Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow He would sing his first war song, And fight his first battle, but something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually. There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown, Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die. She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled \"You won't hurt me no more.\" But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say \"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way\" And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.

    "lyrics": "A hundred years ago I thought happiness was ice cream and football. But time went by so fast Till I couldn't see their attractions at all. I looked around for other pleasures. The old man had shown the way then. Just in time I found women and wine. I marvelled at the way that they united men For the working and middle and upper classes. You didn't need any brains Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies. I'm not basking in reflected glory But open any book and I think you'll find that The greatest men of all time Loved women and wine Or men and wine. Ah, they'll be the death of you If something else doesn't get you first. Well I'm older now And have to take my pleasures in moderation. Least that's what it says here in this guide to Declining years in declining nations. But just 'cause I've slowed up a bit Doesn't mean I can't cheer from the touchline. I hope sons of mine Spend lots of time On women and wine, Women and wine.",

[Chorus] Got me a hidin' in the bushes, Peekin' in the window pane, Shadow moves along the wall, I know you're in there with another man, Tried to get in the front door, Went around to the back door too, I believe you've got a side track man in there, Making my sweet love to you. [Chorus] Makin' my last proclamation, Gonna lay it on the line, Baby I'm runnin' out of patience, And you are runnin' out of time, Tired of all of your mean things, And all your dirty tricks, If I ever turn on you baby, You're gonna be in some kind of fix.

A time before cars and planes and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick. Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man Who never really gave a damn Only thing he worked on was his tan Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night Or if his bones weren't feeling right Or if it looked like it was going to rain He had a tendency of being late for work And everyone around thought he was a jerk He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man Who never really gave a damn Only thing he worked on was his tan Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike! Mike: What, what is it? Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work. Mike: Awww, already? Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes? Mike: No. Mike's dad: Oh. His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough Then go home and take a little nap He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son He just hung around and bothered everyone Never drove a spike, not a single one Though now and then he'd give a tap Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man Who never really gave a damn Only thing he worked on was his tan Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE! Mike: What? What is it? Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails faster than any man alive. Mike: Sounds like a good idea. Mike's dad: No! No! No! Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster. Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs. You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong! Mike: Okay. So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!) He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!) He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!)

Your beauty seem to hypnotize me. I had that feeling I was no longer free. But when I ask you for a dance. (For a dance) You wouldn't even give me a chance. (Me a chance) And it hurt me through and through. That was the first time I got over you. You had my heart dingling, Like a puppet on a string. To you I meant nothing, darling. But to me it meant everything. Girl, you know since then through the years. (Through the years) I've shed so many tears. (So many tears) And all because of you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to. I don't know why I still love you. 'Cause you don't even want me around. Year after year it's the same o' thing. You build me up, to let me down. So go on and hurt me. (Hurt me) Aw, like you did. This time it'll be different. Mmm, my tears you'll see no more. 'Cause I've cried so through the years. (Through the years) Until I run out of tears. (Run out of tears) And all because of you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to. I'll never shed another tear. I couldn't cry no more, darling. Seems as though the pain Have gone the tears from my eyes. Never cry, never. Never no more. I'll never shed another tear.",

Oh, he did everything right He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note I told him I am the flower you are the seed We walked in the garden we planted a tree Don't try to find me, please don't you dare Just live in my memory, you'll always be there All I want to do is make love to you One night of love was all we knew All want to do is make love to you I've got lovin' arms to hold on to Oh, oooh, we made love Love like strangers All night long We made love Then it happened one day, we came round the same way You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes I said please, please understand I'm in love with another man And what he couldn't give me was the one little thing that you can All I want to do is make love to you One night of love was all we knew All I want to do is make love to you Come on, say you will, you want me too All I want to do is make love to you One night of love was all we knew All I want to do is make love to you Say you will, you want me too All night long...",

Champagne corks are firing at the sun again Swooping swallows chased by violins again Straafed by Strauss they sulk in crumbling eaves again. Apertifs consumed en masse display their owners on the grass Couples loiter in the cloisters, social leeches quoting Chaucer. Doctor's son a parson's daughter where why not and should they oughta Please don't lie on the grass, unless accompanied by a fellow, May I be so bold as to suggest Othello. Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say Beagling on the downs Oh please come they say Rugger is the tops a game for men they say. Angie chalks another blue, mother smiles she did it too Chitters chat and gossips lash, posers pose pressmen flash. Smiles polluted with false charm, locking onto Royal arms, Society columns now ensured, return to mingle with the crowds Oh what a crowd.",

If we turned the table upside down and sailed around the bed Clamped knives between our teeth and tied bandannas round our heads With the wainscot our horizon and the ceiling as the sky You'd not expect that anyone would go and fuckin' die Now the only deck that I'd want to walk Are the stalks of corn beneath my feet And the only sea I want to sail Is the darkned pond in the scented dusk Where a kid grow's full of sadness Let us all go drifting out into the evening sun At nights we passed the bottle round and drank to our lost friends We lay alone upon our bunks and prayed that this would end A wall of moving shadows with rows of swinging keys We dreamed that whole Leviathans lay rotting in the weeds There's a sound that comes from miles away if you lean your head to hear A ship's bell rings on board a wreck when the air is still and clear And up above that means another angel's got his wings But all below it signifies is a ship's gone in the drink Now the only deck that I'd want to walk Are the stalks of corn beneath my feet And the only sea I want to sail Is the darkned pond in the scented dusk Where a kid grow's full of sadness Let us all go drifting out into the evening sun",

So we drifted along in silence Till the tickle of life trickled in. And the rhythm began in the hiss of the sand, We were catching fire again. Oh boatman, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea. Oh boatman, taker and giver, Can you deliver me? I would forever run free. Yeah, we finally caught up with legends, We were walking along side by side. We worked out a plan to go out hand in hand, The long trail just wasn't that wide. The water around us was freezing, We just laughed and threw ourselves in. And although we were old, The sting of that cold pumped up the feeling, Here it is again. Oh boatman, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea. Oh boatman, taker and giver, Can you deliver me? I would forever run free. Oh, I'm a message in a bottle Drifting along on a deep blue sea. Waiting for some foreign shore, Ready for something to be. No longer afraid of falling, We cut the strings to the sky. We found lever ground And we put ourselves down, Amazing we all didn't die. We took each moment as given, By second they came. The ice and the sun And the thundering guns, Good God I was finally sane. Oh boatman, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea. Oh boatman, taker and giver, Can you deliver me? Oh holy roller, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea. Oh boatman, taker and giver, Can you deliver me? I would forever run free.",

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded, I see sixes all the way. In a black hole, and I'm spinning As my wings get shot away. No breaks on the inside, Paper cats and burning barns, There's a fox among the chickens, And a killer in the hounds. Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself Shellshock in the kitchen Tables start to burn. [Chorus] But still we walk into the valley And others try to kill the inner flame We're burning brighter than before I don't have a number, I'M A NAME! [Chorus]",

And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight, You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking. And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake, A certain look in the eye and an easy smile. You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to, So that when they turn their backs on you, You'll get the chance to put the knife in. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder. You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older. And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south, Hide your head in the sand, Just another sad old man, All alone and dying of cancer. And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone, Dragged down by the stone. I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused. Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used. Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise. If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze? Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend. And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner And everything's done under the sun, And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with collar and chain. Who was given a pat on the back Who was breaking away from the pack. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end. Who was found dead on the phone. Who was dragged down by the stone.",

The mountain cuts off the town from view, Like a cancer growth is removed by skill. Let it be revealed. A waterfall, his madrigal. An inland sea, his symphony. Undinal songs Urge the sailors on Till lured by sirens' cry. Now as the river dissolves in sea, So Neptune has claimed another soul. And so with gods and men The sheep remain inside their pen, Until the shepherd leads his flock away. The sands of time were eroded by The river of constant change.",

Try to remember when life was so tender When no one wept except the willow. Try to remember when life was so tender When dreams were kept beside your pillow. Try to remember when life was so tender When love was an ember about to billow. Try to remember and if you remember then follow follow. Deep in December it's nice to remember Although you know the snow will follow. Deep in December it's nice to remember Without a hurt the heart will hollow. Deep in December it's nice to remember The fire of September that made you mellow. Deep in December our hearts should remember and follow follow.",

As the clear water of Glaslyn slid Into the dusk, as a sword in it sheath And the distant windows of the mansion reddened Amidst the green branches of the rooks When fatigue silenced the dogs, Night fell on Ynysfor to their sound. And when the creation will darken After its long mad day And the ultimate silence befalls Every worker and every job, Their Latin tones will I warrant you Be neither happy nor sad 'Too whit Too hoo'!",

What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about? I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be. False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities? I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears, But we must live each day like it's the last. Go with it, go with it. [Chorus] Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff, It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff, It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts, Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out. I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors, I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout. She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song. Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong? I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple, You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself. Go with it, go with it.

With no plans for the future He still seems in control From a bronco ride to a ten foot tide He just had to learn to roll. Roll with the punches Play all of his hunches Made the best of whatever came his way What he lacked in ambition He made up with intuition Plowing straight ahead come what may. Steel band in the distance And their music floats across the bay While American women in muumuus Talk about all the things they did today And their husbands quack about fishing As they slug those rum drinks down Discussing who caught what and who sat on his butt But it's the only show in town. They're tryin' to drink all the punches They all may lose their lunches Tryin' to cram lost years into five or six says Seems that blind ambition erased their intuition Plowin' straight ahead come what may. I don't want to live on that kind of island No, I don't want to swim in a roped off sea. Too much for me, too much for me I've got to be where the wind and the water are free. Alone on a midnight passage I can count the falling stars While the Southern Cross and the satellites They remind me of where we are Spinning around in circles Living it day to day And still twenty four hours, maybe sixty good years It's still not that long a stay. We've gotta roll with the punches Learn to play all of our hunches Makin' the best of whatever comes your way Forget that blind ambition And learn to trust your intuition Plowin' straight ahead come what may.

Joseph was an uniportant Slave who found he liked his master, Consequently worked much harder, Even with devotion. Potiphar could see that Joseph Was a cut above the average Made him leader of the household, Maximum promotion. Potiphar was cool and so fine, Potiphar: But my wife would never tow the line. Narrator: It's all there in chapter thirty-nine of Genesis. She was beautiful but Potiphar's wife: evil. Narrator: Saw a lot of men against his will. He would have to tell her That she still was his. Joseph's looks and handsome figure Had attracted her attention Ev'ry morning she would beckon Potiphar's wife: \"Come and lie with me, love.\" Narrator: Joseph wanted to resist her 'Till one day she proved too eager. Joseph cried in vain, Joseph: \"Please stop! I don't believe in free love!\" Narrator: Potiphar was counting shekels In his den below the bedroom When he heard a mighty rumpus Clattering above him. Suddenly he knew his riches Couldn't buy him what he wanted Gold would never make him happy If she didn't love him. Letting out a mighty roar, Potiphar burst through the door Potiphar: Joseph, I'll see you rot in jail. The thing you have done are beyond the pale. Narrator: Poor, poor Joseph, locked up in a cell. Things aren't going well, hey, Locked up in a cell. Poor poor joseph Locked up in a cell Things aren't going well, hey, Locked up in a cell Locked up In a cell",
